# voyager.qmk
My ZSA Voyager QMK configuration.

- Uses colemak.
- Has separate utility layers for both halves.
- Numpad layer.
- Gaming layers.
    - Solo (QWERTY)
    - Dual (W A S D & ^ < v >) for playing 2-player keyboard games
- Home row (or bottom-row, still TBD) modifiers (either standard tap-dance, or SMTD, TBD).
- Vim arrow keys for both hands.
- Has Ralt/AltGR/Compose.
- Accident proof keys (need to be double tapped to activate).
    - Lock button: Meta-L, works with most linux/BSD DEs, and widows, but not mac.
    - Dual / solo gaming layer.
- Has tap-dance symbol keys [tap: (, hold: )] [tap, {, hold: }] [tap: [, hold: ]].

Additionally, it has been optimized for developer experience via macros and formatting.

It was originally made with ZSA's Oryx.
